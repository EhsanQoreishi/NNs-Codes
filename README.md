**Utilization of Artificial Neural Networks for Evaluation of the Randomness Level of Mathematically Manipulated Data Sets Attained Numerically from Chuaâ€™s Circuit**


As a result of the philosophical and, therefore, the mathematical complexity of coming up with a working definition for the concept of a random series, the current research takes a rather pragmatic approach to the problem. According to the definition of randomness at an objective level, there can be no unbiased choice, which as far as physical setups are concerned, is too abstract to occur in real life. Accordingly, the question manifests itself in the subjective realm and being random results in the lack of instructional information from the observer's perspective. As a first step in establishing the scope of the required definition for the concept of randomness, this paper offers five distinct artificial neural network configurations based on a mathematical derivation of a well-known chaotic signal, that of Chua's circuit. Considering the individual constant capacity of each network configuration to predict and bypass the physical generation of chaotic signals, the manuscript argues the validity of such a mechanism as a criterion for relative statistical randomness levels of the said derivative signals and ranks them accordingly. The two-fold result of the work is accordingly the establishment of the latter methodology and the presentation of a set of mathematical functions derived from the numerical solution of the classic configuration of Chua's Circuit.
